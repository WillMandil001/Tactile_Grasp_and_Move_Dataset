# Tactile_Grasp_and_Move_Dataset

We collected a dataset with a range of human teleoperated kinesthetic motions enabling a random and diverse dataset. The dataset consists of: (i) robot proprioception data in joint and task space, enabling action conditioning (ii) tactile data from both fingers of the gripper (iii) object position and orientation with respect to the robot's wrist. We used a human operator to intentionally create necessary accelerations in some cases to cause slippage for our case study in qualitative analysis. These motions are more complex than linear motions and more dense in slip cases and diverse tactile sensations than a random motion based dataset.
